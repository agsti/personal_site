#### Blank canvas


I like to think of software engineering as the repeating process of

- Define the problem to solve
- Analyzing constraints
- Taking decisions / Making choices
- Change the code in some way

The first three parts are the parts that make for the engineering part of this job. The last one is where I'd say the where the art is.  

Let's start with the engineering bit I mentioned. Just like every change in the code depends on the previous code. Every decision you take also depends on all the previous decisions that have been taken since the inception of that software.

It is a very different environment to take decisions with few constraints than it is to be taking decisions down the line.
Some decisions will have really big impact! and we better take them right.
Those decisions will determine the life of all the developers that will go through the codebase.
In my experience, to get better at anything you need to fail at it few times before. And what a better place to fail than from the comfort of your house?. The only consequence being that you will learn a bit more? 

That's why I think we all need a blank canvas somewhere. Somewhere where you can experiment, somewhere where you can fail without anyone noticing. Somewhere where we can grow.




it was very surprising to me how diferent it is to develop stuff on your own to be part of a company building software.

I think that building software on my own, it's way more artistic while on the other hand, 

Both environments have its pros and cons.

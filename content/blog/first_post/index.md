Hey! I'm Agusti, I guess if you want to know more you can look at my [CV](/) or my [projects page](/projects) or find me in some social network. I'm not good at introductions.

Today it's an important day! I've been wanting to have some online presence for a while. For the last decade almost I'm what some people on the internet would call a *lurker* 
> lurker: a person who lurks, in particular a user of an Internet message board or chat room who does not participate.

(I needed an excuse to use those quotes, they look neat don't they?)

Most of the people on the internet nowadays are lurkers. I'm just one more.

There are many reasons for that, but mainly I find the current interwebs situation to be overwhelming. Every mainstream platform has millions or billions of users, I feel like anything I say there, would instantly get drowned in the noise.

Also, I don't feel incentivized to post just being *another user*, just one more post in the thousands of them that get posted every day.

I mean nowadays there are a few platforms I respect. Like [dev.to](http://dev.to) or [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/). They are cool, I wouldn't mind being there. But like any other decent online platform, there's a chance that they will grow and lose control. *cough medium, cough, cough*

Back then I remember using myspace, that was cool. Everyone had their fair share of self-expression and the mood was way nicer. Two things that I miss from old-school social networks.

I guess the only problem will be discoverability, but I'll pay this price to at least not sell your eyeballs for some peanuts.

Speak soon.

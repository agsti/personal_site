## Problem
- Android doesn't have a [Remote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remote/id1459548957) app.
- Apple remotes getting discontinued after 2011.
- Existing apps need some software running on the computer.
- Existing app did not support a lot of common media playing software.

## Solution
An Android app made to control OSX devices. Offering features such as media controls, volume control, remote shutdown.

Relying on an ssh connection to the computer to send commands. Because OSx already has an ssh server running, it's a simple solution.

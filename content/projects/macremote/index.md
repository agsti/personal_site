This was my first experience at self developing something and releasing it to the wild.

It was an Android app made to control OSX devices from said smartphones. Media controls, volume control, remote shutdown... among those lines.
The neat trick that it had, was that it didn't need any specific software running on the mac itself! It used a combination of SSH access and inlining AppleScript commands. 
But it required ssh credentials, which I would not recomment anyone to share in exchange of comfort.

It got [some](https://lifehacker.com/mac-remote-controls-your-mac-from-the-comfort-of-your-a-5991748) [press](https://www.xda-developers.com/use-your-android-as-a-remote-control-on-mac/) atention and got about 200k downloads. After a 3 year run and about 20 updates. Eventually better solutions appeared and I lost interest.

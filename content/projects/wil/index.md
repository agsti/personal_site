This is my latest project! Again I'm trying to look at my nuances when I was looking for a place to live in London.

I noticed that my pattern when checking out flats online. I'd match price & all that, then go to google maps and check commute times to a couple of places I'd go frequently. I would make sure were under some reasonable time, and if so I'd move ahead.

Now repeat the milion emails I sent when looking for a place, and it's a nuance. :p

So I'm building a website that allows to search properties within a comute time from a point. 
I'm also experimenting with diferent backend technologies in order to spice my developer life a bit.

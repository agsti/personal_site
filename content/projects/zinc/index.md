## Problem
4th phase clinical trials are used to measure the effect of drugs on the public for a long period of time.
They require a lot of time and money to be conducted
Proacto wanted to conduct them remotely in order to reduce the cost.

The assumption was that by performing timely questionaires to the patients and allowing a researcher to monitor their responses, patients would not need to be visited.

## Solution
The product was a data driven questionaire platform. It allowed multiple kinds of questionaires.

The following features were built:
- Onboarding registering screens
- Data driven questionaires. At some point would have been obtained from an api
- Dashboard where questionaires would be queued, and general overview would be provided
- Video questionaires: Video recording & reviewing
- Chatbot questionaries: Using react-native-gifted-chat I implemented a simple bot questionarie
- Regular questionaire: Implemented multiple kinds of questions (numeric, range, categoric answer, free form... ). By hand, with some nice animations

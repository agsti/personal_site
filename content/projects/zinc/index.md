## Background
This is not a personal project, but as I was the only developer it would be very close to one.
This project took place while I was part of [Zinc.vc](http://www.zinc.vc), a startup incubator with a social mission. 

I tried to kickstar this venture with my good friend [Tom Hedley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hedleyconsulting/). 

We wanted to reduce the price of running clinical trials by conducting part of the trial remotely.

## Pain-point
What we wanted to do was to was to help conduct 4th phase clinical trials remotely. Those kind of trials are done for a long time, when the treatment has already been tested, and its main purpose is to watch its effect on the public.

We assumed that by performing timely questionaires to the patients and allowing a researcher to monitor their responses we would be able to reduce the cost of running a clinical trial.

## Product
The product that we built was a data driven questionaire platform. We allowed multiple kinds of questionaires. The features I implemented were the following:
- Onboarding registering screens
- Data driven questionaires. At some point would have been obtained from an api
- Dashboard where questionaires would be queued, and general overview would be provided
- Video questionaires: Video recording & reviewing
- Chatbot questionaries: Using react-native-gifted-chat I implemented a simple bot questionarie
- Regular questionaire: Implemented multiple kinds of questions (numeric, range, categoric answer, free form... ). By hand, with some nice animations
